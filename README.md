1.Graph Algorithm Visualization:
The project features a visual representation of two fundamental graph algorithms, namely Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). Users can interactively explore and comprehend the operational dynamics of these algorithms through graphical illustrations, enhancing their understanding of traversal strategies in graph structures.

2.Sorting Algorithm Visualization:
The algorithm visualizer further encompasses a comprehensive display of sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort. Through intuitive graphics, users gain insights into the step-by-step execution of each sorting method, facilitating a visual understanding of their respective approaches to arranging data.
